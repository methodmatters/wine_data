Cecconi, a celebrated Italian post-impressionist, was a personal friend of Lodovico Antinori's grandfather, Piero Antinori.

"Neyers Syrah Cuvee D'Honneur 2005",14.1,2005,48.99,"California","Syrah/Shiraz","Red Wines","Given the historically high interest in 'natural' products of all types, it's no surprise that wines made with lower than normal levels of sulphites would begin to develop a following. This is especially true in France, where a handful of talented young winemakers are producing some of the most exciting wines in their appellations by taking a 'non-intervention' approach to winemaking. It's a high stakes gamble that requires enormous attention to detail, along with a fresh approach to traditional cellar practices. One of the acknowledged leaders of the movement is Thierry Allemand of Cornas, whose 'Cuvee Special' Cornas is thought to be the benchmark example of Northern Rhone Syrah. Allemand has kindly shared his winemaking ideas with us over the years, encouraging us to try these techniques with our Syrah. We have recognized his role by naming the resulting wine 'Cuvee d'Honneur'. In 2005, our Cuvee d'Honneur Syrah took a dramatic step forward in both complexity and intensity. The production remains small, by necessity -- less than 10 barrels. The aroma is a striking combination of multiple spices, with earthy tones of bacon fat and leather. The real charm, though, is the underlying fruit. Big, grapey and supple, this wine is a textbook example of the heights reachable with old world technique and new world fruit."

The summer months continued on the mild to cool side, with few days topping 100 degrees. There was a brief period of heat that spiked around Labor Day, but the temperatures cooled after several days. This year clusters, as well as individual berries on the clusters though set at a normal quantity were notably smaller in all varieties due to the dry season.

The steepest, most exposed blocks create very ripe Pinot noir with deeply colored, often dense and multilayered wines, while the more sheltered, gentler slopes yield more subtle, mineral red-fruited wines. Their preferences often depend on the vintage. The 2012 Meyer combines fruit from multiple aspects of the vineyard to make a balanced, admittedly opulent wine. The fragrant nose reveals blueberry and kirsch accented by anise, smoke, sandalwood and earth. The palate is bright and fresh with focused, lithe red fruit driving to the finish, highlighted by darker fruit notes."
"Cakebread Benchland Select Cabernet Sauvignon 1998",14.4,1998,109,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","The winemaking regimen for the Benchland Select included using the rack and return process of draining the fermenting juice off the skins and then returning it to the stainless steel tanks. This procedure greatly reduces the young wine's astringency by softening its tannins while deepening its dark color. As the wine was fermented dry, it was taste-tested for optimum flavor levels before it was separated from the skins and then aged for twenty-six months in a combination of new (65%) and one year old (35%) French oak barrels. The resulting wine reflects the exceptional quality of the fruit sourced from three select vineyards in the Napa Valley's western foothills; including Jack and Dolores Cakebread's own Hill Ranch. The 1998 Benchland Select Cabernet Sauvignon displays aromas of an intense red fruit character and the spiciness of mocha, cocoa and nutmeg.

The secret to Hundred Acre is no compromise and no detail overlooked, ever. The single estate vineyard ARK is located just outside St. Helena, California, at the base of Howell Mountain. It was originally planted in the 1880's, but was sadly lost to Prohibition. It took us five years to rebuild; she is our pride and joy. As with all of our vineyards, we pick only when the fruit is perfectly ripe; this doesn't always happen at once. It is common for us to make multiple passes through the vineyard, picking different clusters from the same vines as they reach perfect maturity. This attention to detail is critical to making a wine the caliber of Hundred Acre."

The maturity of our own vineyards as well as several new growers we have added over the years has given us an even broader spectrum of individual lots to choose from, for making our top blend.

"Bergstrom Bergstrom Vineyard Pinot Noir 2009",14.1,2009,79.99,"Oregon","Pinot Noir","Red Wines","Deep ruby red in color, the 2008 Bergstrom Vineyard Pinot Noir is a potentially monumental Oregon Pinot Noir that has intense and ripe youthful aromas of dark cherry, red raspberry, chocolate, sweet spice and pepper, violets and the trademark ferrous (Iron) mineral quality. The Bergstrom Vineyard Pinot Noir always flirts within three different expressions of fruit, savory and mineral. At different periods of its ageing process, you will find the wine leaning more towards one than the other. In youth the wine tends to lean towards fruit and as it ages the wine goes through savory and then shows more mineral. This wine is medium to full bodied and will begin to drink well towards the summer of 2010 and will age well for at least a decade. This young 2008 reminds me very much of the 2002 which is still drinking beautifully with years ahead of it."

"Paraduxx  2005",14.5,2005,53.99,"California","Other Red Blends","Red Wines","Paraduxx is a unique Napa Valley red wine with its foundation in Zinfandel, California's resident grape, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Created in 1994 to provide the winemaking team with the opportunity to explore other varietals, Paraduxx was quickly recognized as having its own personality and style. Blended with Napa Valley mountain fruit as well as valley floor grapes from Estate vineyards, Paraduxx has rich, full fruit flavors and soft, integrated tannins, making it a natural complement to a wide array of foods. For each vintage, an artist's interpretation of a pair of ducks native to the Pacific Flyway is featured on the label. Each vintage, Paraduxx celebrates an artist-label series with a different artist's signature medium and style interpreted through a pair of ducks native to the Pacific Flyway. The 2005 Paraduxx label is the twelfth in this series. For this release, Canadian artist Patrice Wolput created an oil painting of a pair of Red Head ducks. Other varietals may add their voices to this very rich wine, and Cabernet Sauvignon, in particular, brings a firm streak of tannin, but the wine is very much Zinfandel at its heart and is rife with very deep blackberry fruit and vanilla. Full and fleshy in feel, if still a bit astringent on the back end, it is beginning to hint at complexity to come and deserves to be left alone for some three or four more years.-Connoisseurs' Guide"

"Matetic EQ Syrah 2008",14.5,2008,43,"South America","Syrah/Shiraz","Red Wines","The Syrah vineyards are located in two sections of Rosario Valley, both are almost flat with a slight inclination to the north. The ground is of granite origin, deep and of coluvial. The grapes are from clones 174 and 300. The careful handling of foliage and the load along with controlled watering allow for yields less than 5 tons per hectare, thus achieving perfect and slow maturity of the grape in this cold climate of San Antonio. The fermentation took place in open tanks of 4 tons capacity. The grapes were cold macerated before fermenting with selected yeasts. The wine was later placed in carefully-selected casks of French oak, where the malolactic fermentation was carried out and then remained for 12 months before bottling. A dark violet color, almost black, exhibiting the characteristic aromas of Syrah with notes of spices, including pepper, and fruits like black cherry and blackberry, all mixed in a surprising complexity.

"Dutton Goldfield Sanchietti Vineyard Pinot Noir 2008",13.5,2008,53.99,"California","Pinot Noir","Red Wines","There's good news and bad news about the 2008 Sanchietti. The good news is that it's as deep, rich and unctuous as any Sanchietti we've made. The bad news is that the vineyard yield was the most pitiful we've seen since the almost nonexistent 2003 harvest, so only 240 total cases were produced. The sparse set and warm, dry harvest season gave the Sanchietti fruit thick skins and a tiny juice yield. The resulting wine is unusually extracted for this vineyard, but the tannins are still silky and the fresh blueberry fruit is still at the core. In the nose, the wine is blueberries and black cherry compote, along with coriander and toffee overtones. In the mouth, the thickness of the 2008 vintage is immediately apparent, supporting a sweet core of blackberry and blueberry fruit and carried by wonderfully fine but substantial tannin core. This is a beautifully generous wine for current drinking, whose balance will also carry it for many years to come. Enjoy with a barbequed salmon, roasted quail, or any dish with mushrooms."

"Saintsbury Brown Ranch Pinot Noir 2007",14.5,2007,55.99,"California","Pinot Noir","Red Wines","To produce a single vineyard wine you should be convinced the vineyard has something unique and identifiable to offer. It should be a vineyard that will yield a wine whose intensity and personality you are unable to obtain in your other wines. We knew this about our Brown Ranch after the first harvest of its Pinot Noir grapes in 1995. There are eight lots that are separately fermented, aged and assessed. And while each has its unique qualities due to clonal, rootstock and terroir differences, there is a consistent thread running though these Brown Ranch pinot noirs. The ranch has a combination of typical Carneros clay loams and cobbly clay loams as well as some volcanic soil types on steeper hillsides. Wines from this vineyard show more rich earthiness and black fruit than the more red-fruit character of other lots in our cellar. A dark fruit intensity with stunning persistence is a hallmark of this wine. Less than a third of the pinot noir from this, our best vineyard site, goes into the Brown Ranch Pinot Noir each year. It is packaged into six-bottle boxes with a package design that pays tribute to George Saintsbury."

Rich tannins make ONEHOPE Merlot a perfect match with a range of main courses including meats, pastas and vegetarian dishes. ONEHOPE donates half of pro?ts from the sale of every bottle of Merlot to END7 to join in the goal of ending neglected tropical diseases by 2020. Neglected tropical diseases affect one in six people worldwide, so we felt it was important to support a program to end these terrible diseases. Every bottle of ONEHOPE Merlot provides a simple packet of pills that treats and protects one person from all seven NTDs for up to a year. The effects are nearly immediate. Just days after taking the pills, children become energetic, engaged and able to concentrate in school. Treating people with NTDs is one of the easiest ways to help them escape poverty and achieve their full potential."

"Yalumba Cabernet Sauvignon The Cigar 2008",14,2008,22.99,"Australia","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","Like its elder sibling Yalumba The Menzies, Yalumba The Cigar is made through small lot winemaking techniques. The grapes are crushed to small static fermenters and, once the fermentation commences, the temperature is allowed to peak early at 30 °C, then given more control around 20 °C. This ensures good extraction of colour and tannin. The grapes stay on skins for around seven days, though some tanks are given extended skin contact before pressing. The wine is matured for 16 months in mainly French oak hogsheads. Deep magenta in color with a nose of full intensity, the Cigar 2008 is a brooding wine showing leather, dark chocolate and high tones of cassis and jujube fruit pastilles. The palate surprises as it is not the brute the nose suggests. It is a medium bodied wine with fruit flavours of dark cherries and blackberries. The tannins are silky smooth and act in harmony with the fruit for a lingering finish."

"Kenwood Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon 2005",14.5,2005,65.99,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","Our 2005 Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon is a luscious wine with great depth and focused tannins. It exhibits complex aromas of cassis, tea leaves and a hint of licorice. The wine is ready for enjoyment now but its full-bodied flavor will allow it to improve for many years. The 2005 Vintage marks the 31st release of Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon from Kenwood Vineyards. The harvest produced a bountiful crop of Cabernet Sauvignon with a distinctly rich and complex flavor that is followed by spicy and aromatic notes. After picking, the grapes were crushed and fermented in stainless steel tanks and then settled and racked twice before going down to barrels in December of 2005. After 29 months of barrel aging the very best lots were carefully selected and then blended and bottled. After bottling, the wine was aged for an additional year and a half before it was released. Each year since the 1975 vintage our winemakers taste individual barrels of our finest lots of Cabernet Sauvignon at the end of aging and select only the best to become part of the Artist Series blend. The result is a flavorful and intense wine that represents less than 2% of our total Cabernet Sauvignon production. About the Artist Swiss-born German artist Paul Klee (1879-1940) was a major contributor to 20th century art not only with his paintings but also with his theory, teachings and written compositions. Influenced by travels to Egypt, his monumental Highway and Byways (1929) is a reflection of rhythm and proportion, an interpretation of landscape divided by vertical and horizontal networks. It is one of his many profound works that illustrate his ability to experiment with and invent new ways of expression."

"Drew The Gatekeepers Blend Pinot Noir 2009",14.2,2009,35.99,"California","Pinot Noir","Red Wines","The concept of The Gatekeepers has always been about synergizing two excellent but markedly different sites from opposite sides of a single appellation. In this case, the appellation is the very exciting Mendocino Ridge AVA. Both vineyards qualify to be in the Mendocino Ridge as they are both ridge-top vineyards above the minimum 1,200 ft. requirement and are both less than 10 miles from the ocean. In other words both sites receive lots of wind and cool sunshine hours. As the fog typically sits at the 800ft level, any vineyards above that line receive more sunlight hours, yet those hours are cooler from the natural air conditioning of the fog. These two stellar vineyards include Manchester Ridge Vineyard and Perli Vineyard, both absolutely worthy of single vineyard designates but when they meet, they elevate each other in an undeniable marriage. There are too many words to describe this wine here but just think along the lines of these few descriptors and not in any special order: Rose stems, sandal wood, quince, pomegranates, cherry gelato, minerals, red pepper corns, carpaccio, a newly cut dozen roses, hints of fresh spearmint . The flavors are lively with floral notes, wild red fruits, spice and sweet earth. The tannins and acid are very much in line with classic fruit weight. An elegant high altitude, coastal Pinot Noir!

With a fruity intensity typical of wines from Coastal Maipo, notes of red fruit such as strawberries, raspberries and blackcurrants intermingle with aromas of black pepper and hints of damp tobacco. With a soft, elegant body, this wine reveals balanced structure and good acidity, which increases its complexity. The tannins are noticeable but soft. Long in the finish. Pairs perfectly with mature cheese, grilled red meat and well-seasoned dishes."

"Cycles Gladiator Cabernet Sauvignon 2011",14.5,2011,10.99,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","The Cycles Gladiator Cabernet Sauvignon is a bold and expressive red wine with rousing aromas and intense flavor. Fragrances of blueberries and hot chocolate give this wine a semisweet aroma complimented by slight hints of soft spices. A taste reveals flavors reminiscent of a black cherry reduction and coffee ice cream, supported by plush tannins and asoft mouthfeel, ending with a rounded finish and a touch of dryness. This full bodied Cabernet is equally at home at a casual barbecue served up with slow roast pork shoulder or at dinner with Cabernet marinated flank steak."
"Clos Pegase Napa Cabernet Sauvignon 2009",14.7,2009,49.99,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","The 2009 Clos Pegase Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon shows saturated ruby purple color. It has intense, complex dark-fruit notes of ripe black cherry, blackberry coulis and plum framed by dark chocolate, graphite, violets and a touch of sweet incense smoke. This wine deftly balances hedonistic fruit, tannic power and breadth of mouthfeel with rich mid-palate weight and a lengthy exotic-fruit finish."
"Borsao Tinto 2011",14,2011,10,"Spain","Grenache","Red Wines","Unlike some of its Borsao stablemates, this bottling isn't gushing with fruit in the nose, but it has something more: balance. Black cherries and blueberries coincide with gentle vanilla and toast, and mineral and rock elements finish the wine, along with a whisp of citrusy crispness. Drink now or in the next several years."
"Shea Block 5 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir 2009",15.2,2009,52.99,"Oregon","Pinot Noir","Red Wines","We made our Pinot Noir Block 5 from Dijon clone 777 fruit sourced from Block 5 on the East hill of Shea vineyard. This steep, south-facing slope produced grapes that yield a concentration of dark juicy fruit on the nose and palate.

"Gramercy Cellars John Lewis Walla Walla Valley Syrah 2010",13.9,2010,85,"Washington","Syrah/Shiraz","Red Wines","The 2010 John Lewis will reward patience. Right now, it's tight. To me, it's a truly northern Rhone-style wine. It's not made to be drunk in the next six months. If you open it right now and give it a bad review, we can't be friends anymore. Give it some time. I predict in 10 years or so we will all be talking about this vintage."
"Duckhorn Three Palms Merlot 2005",14.5,2005,78.99,"California","Merlot","Red Wines","This concentrated wine has a velvety texture, bright acidity, and firm, well-integrated tannins. The aroma is layered with red fruit, dried herbs, allspice, vanilla bean, and a hint of dust. On the palate, the flavors are dominated by dark red fruits, including ripe strawberries and dried cherries, with inviting accents of toasted oak, chocolate, and spice. In the late 1800s, the land that is now home to the Three Palms Vineyard was a residence for famed San Francisco socialite Lillie Hitchcock Coit. She left her mark on San Francisco in the form of Coit Tower. She left her mark on the Napa Valley in the form of three lone palm trees, which were all that remained from her estate after the house fell into disuse and ruin. The 83-acre vineyard is located on the northeast side of the Napa Valley in an alluvial fan created by the outwash of Selby Creek where it spills out of Dutch Henry Canyon. The site is covered with volcanic stones washed down over the centuries from the canyon. The soil is rocky and well drained, causing the vines to send their roots far, wide, and deep to find the necessary nutrients and water. The stones aid the vineyard, absorbing the sun's heat during the day and radiating the heat during the night to protect the vines during frost season and help ripen the fruit. Except for a few vintages, we have produced a Three Palms Merlot since the inaugural 1978 vintage. Black-garnet hue with a fuchsia rim. Forward aromas of plum, cherry compote and warm caramel. Classic Three Palms fruit with a combination of power and finesse emitting layers of black cherry, plum, sweet oak and cedar accents. Youthful tannins do surface in the finish giving apt support to the lingering sweetness.-Wine News"
"Paul Cluver Pinot Noir 2008",13.5,2008,21.99,"South Africa","Pinot Noir","Red Wines","The essence of a great Pinot noir is the purity of the fruit and structure of the wine. The 2008 Paul Cluver Pinot noir has this essence which is substantiated by its natural acidity. The color has a luminosity, reminiscent of ripe cherries. The nose is a combination of red berry with hints of spice, mushrooms and dark chocolate. The palate is packed with flavors linked to the nose - red berry fruit, hints of spice, and a touch of wood yet maintaining a well structured, mineral core. Very well balanced, structured and poised. As elegant as great Pinot noirs tend to be."
"Ramey Pedregal Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2008",15,2008,165,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","Our fifth vintage from this small, outstanding vineyard on the lower slopes of the eastern Oakville hills. Pedregal means a rocky place in Spanish, and that is certainly a distinguishing feature of the site. During 2008 we agreed to a long-term lease of this vineyard which gives us complete control even through any change in ownership, so this is the first vintage we've directed farming ourselves (we converted to organic). Aging the 2008 on its fine lees has coated the tannins and smoothly integrated the wood, and we left this vintage 26 months in completely new barrels yet it's hard to find the oak. The Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot (16%) were harvested in two passes two days apart and co-fermented. As with all of our wines, this was fermented with native yeasts and bacteria and bottled without filtration."
"Raymond Reserve Selection Cabernet Sauvignon 2009",14.5,2009,40,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","Very concentrated aromas of mixed berry patch, boysenberry, molasses and blueberry are followed by hints of cedar and anise.

"Cakebread Dancing Bear Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon 2008",15.1,2008,109,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","The 2008 Dancing Bear delights the senses with heady, deeply concentrated and wonderfully complex aromas of black plum, crushed boysenberry, ripe olallieberry, fig, earth, baking spices and chocolate. On the dense, weighty palate, the wine delivers intense, mouthfilling, blackberry, black cherry, boysenberry and forest-floor spice flavors supported by supple, chewy tannins and a long, mouth-coating finish enriched by dark chocolate and toasted oak tones. Big and youthful with layers of intensely concentrated flavors, this dramatic mountain red drinks well now, but it will continue to evolve and become complex in bottle over the next decade."
"CARO Amancaya 2010",14.5,2010,20,"South America","Bordeaux Red Blends","Red Wines","Intense, deep crimson color. On the nose, aromas of red and dark fruit, with redcurrants and plums, also some mint and cedar. The bouquet fills out with notes of vanilla, spices and mocha. This wine has a pleasant tannic structure on the palate and shows good balance. Fine, mellow tannins. Very pleasant soft mouthfeel.

Montiano is deep ruby-red in color and exhibits a wide range of aromas, from vanilla to red berries and fruit along with layers of jam and sweet spice. It is powerful and full-bodied, yet well-rounded on the palate with an elegant and lingering finish. One of the most sought after wines from central Italy."
"Trinchero Meritage 2007",14,2007,48.99,"California","Bordeaux Red Blends","Red Wines","Unlike the majority of our wines that are single-vineyard, this wine is a blend of choice lots from several of our prime estate vineyards and varies year to year. In 2007 we hand selected barrels of Cabernet from our Cloud's Nest Vineyard on Mt. Veeder and our Haystack Vineyard on Atlas Peak; Merlot from our Vista Montone Vineyard in Southern Napa; and Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc from our Central Park West Vineyard in St. Helena. This is my favorite wine to make because, like having all the crayons in the box, it lets me paint the prettiest picture. Having an incredible arsenal of vineyards at my disposal enables me to make a wine with layers and layers of aromas and flavors. Cabernet is the backbone, Merlot contributes to the mid-palate and the aromatics, Petit Verdot adds color and floral aromatics, and Cabernet Franc elongates the finish. Mario Monticelli."

Veeder characteristics. Dried cherry, dried herb, briar patch, tobacco and tea aromas are complimented by plum, wild cherry and forest floor flavors with pronounced tannins and a long finish. This is a wine that I think has incredible cellaring potential, but as 2007 is my first vintage with this fruit, we'll have to be patient. However, this wine, like all my wines, should drink well upon release too."

"Luce Della Vite Brunello di Montalcino 2006",15.5,2006,119,"Italy","Sangiovese","Red Wines","The overall judgement on the 2006 vintage is very positive, in particular for the quality level of the grapes brought in. Spring was characterised by temperate conditions, scarce rains, and lack of heat stress, all of which favored sound, healthy fruit. Light rains during the summer helped maintain groundwater reserves for the vines. August was not excessively hot, with the result that ripeness in the various sections of the grape (pulp, skin, pip) developed evenly and with good balance. September and October brought sunny days, dry and crisp, which were the desired conditions for producing all of the qualities necessary to the making of high-quality, firmly-structured wines. Luce Brunello appears ruby red with garnet highlights. Fragrances of wild berry fruit, such as blueberry and redcurrant, predominate on the nose; crisp notes of citrus follow, succeeded in turn by spicier impressions of forest underbrush, tobacco leaf, pencil lead, and black pepper, all lifted by intriguing nuances of star anice and China Calassaja bark.

"Alexander Valley Vineyards Sin Zin Zinfandel 2009",14.4,2009,20,"California","Zinfandel","Red Wines","In 1978 Hank Wetzel produced the very first vintage of Sin Zin. The wine was an immediate hit with spicy, jammy, elegant fruit flavors and an unforgettable label. Thirty two years later, Sin Zin is one of the most recognizable wines in the country. From the beginning Sin Zin has been a more elegant style of Zinfandel due to both the region and winemaking style. We harvest the grapes from throughout the Alexander Valley - including the valley floor, hillsides and benchlands to get a wide range of complex red fruit flavors in the glass. Since 1999 winemaker Kevin Hall has carried on the tradition looking for a balance of ripeness and acidity in each lot to showcase the elegance of the region. This balance explains Sin Zin's restaurant popularity; it is always a food friendly style of Zinfandel. 2009 was a cooler vintage with fewer heat spikes than in the past few years, allowing for uniform ripening in the Alexander Valley which led to wines with good structure, balance and complexity. Overall, the vintage is more elegant than in many recent years. Kevin blended in a small amount of Petite Sirah to broaden the mouthfeel on the wine and add a little more dark fruit to the palate. There are aromas of raspberry, plum, black cherry, and a touch of citrus. Flavors of plum, black cherry, black pepper, spice and pomegranate fill the glass.

"Francis Ford Coppola Diamond Collection Petite Sirah 2011",13.9,2011,18.99,"California","Petite Sirah","Red Wines","Grown in various warm weather regions throughout California, including Lodi, Paso Robles, and Dry Creek Valley, Petite Sirah is one of the most intense red varietals in terms of color and tannin, which is why it's frequently used as a blending grape to add pigment or phenols. The varietal also produces small berries in tight clusters; a factor that contributes to its concentration. To avoid extracting too much tannin from our fruit, we press the grapes very gently in order to achieve a more delicate style of wine that doesn't need years in the cellar. After a frigid spring, moderate temperatures persisted throughout the 2011 growing season, delaying harvest until very late in the fall. This extra time on the vines allowed the fruit to develop profuse aromatics and deeper flavor concentration because the maturation process was slow, making this year's Petite Sirah wonderfully fragrant and very layered in flavor. The palate is lush with plenty of rich fruit and exotic spices. Tasting Profile Appearance: Deep purple Aromas: Berries, currants, cloves and lavender Flavors: Plums, cherries, cocoa, and vanilla toasted oak Blend: 90% Petite Sirah, 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Merlot"
"CADE Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon 2009",15.2,2009,79.99,"California","Cabernet Sauvignon","Red Wines","The CADE Cabernet Sauvignon Howell Mountain is sourced from five small growers on Howell Mountain: CADE Estate Vineyards, Ink Grade Vineyards, Outpost Vineyards, True and Eagle Summit Vineyards. The 2009 harvest on Howell Mountain began on October 11th and lasted through October 30st. The 2009 vintage was a challenging one on Howell Mountain but the decision to thin heavily in our estate vineyards as well as our grower's vineyards paid huge dividends in October when the small crop achieved physiological/phenolic ripeness. The cooler 2009 vintage gave us a higher acidity on Howell Mountain and that in turn gives the wine a wonderful freshness. On the palette, flavors of chocolate, mint, currant, and vanilla bean are revealed. The tannins are firm but not obtrusive and the wine can easily age for the next 6-9 years."

Not exactly fresh fruit and not really jam, either. Rather, it's like a bunch of summer fruit strawberry, raspberry, fig, and huckleberry all conserved together in one aromatic package. It's sophisticated in the depth of its aroma profile and fun at the same time. The flavors are a big surprise as well no jammy sweetness. Instead the wine is taut, refined and reminiscent of a very fine Tuscan Chianti and absolutely the right counterpoint to the aromas.

"Dom. Chante-Perdrix Chateauneuf-du-Pape 2006",15,2006,40,"France - Rhone","Rhone Red Blends","Red Wines","The wines of Chante Perdrix are traditional in the best sense, and they are authentic, long-lived exaples of the venerable terroir of Chateauneuf-du-Pape. The red wine is made in the traditional manner, with ageing in the large oad casks and bottling from 18-24 months after the harvest. It is firm, rich, and spicy, developing slowly to a warm, satisfyingly complex maturity. Chante Perdrix produces one of the more exotic and intriguing wines of Chateauneuf du Pape. In top vintages, such as 1989, this is an undeniably flamboyant and dramatic wine. The estate is modestly sized (45 acres), and the red wine is made from a traditional blend of 80% Grenache, 6% Syrah, 6% Muscardin, and 2% other varietals. The average age of .(the) vineyards is an impressive 55 years. Additionally, this is one of the few single-estate vineyards with the entire vineyard located in the Southern part of the appellation, in the sector known as Condorcet Guy Nicolet, a quiet and unassuming man, diminutive in stature, produces wines that are the reverse of his personality. Enormously fruity, voluptuous in texture and extroverted, they represent Chateauneuf du Pape at its most seductive. Fanciers of this style are best advised to drink Chante Perdrix within the first 10-15 years of (its) life. Although not one of the appellation's longest-lived wines, it is one of the most delicious. - Robert M. Parker, Jr. Wines of the Rhone Valley, 2nd Edition (1997)"

The bouquet begins with fruity aromas of dried cherries, blueberries and cassis and is followed by spicy aromatic notes of sage and sassafras. The mouthfeel of the wine is full bodied with well-structured tannins, flavors of pomegranate and hints of vanilla. This wine is delicious now and should continue to improve for at least a decade. The 2006 Vintage marks the 32nd release of Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon from Kenwood Vineyards. The 2006 growing season began with a wet and cool spring, followed by a warm and dry summer. In late September and early October, the weather cooled and we harvested the Cabernet Sauvignon that produced this year's Artist Series blend. After picking, the grapes were crushed and fermented in stainless steel tanks and then settled and racked twice before going down to barrels in December of 2006. After 28 months of barrel aging, the very best lots were carefully selected, blended and bottled. After bottling, the wine was aged for an additional year and a half before it was released. Each year since the 1975 vintage, our winemakers taste individual barrels of our finest lots of Cabernet Sauvignon at the end of aging and select only the best to become part of the Artist Series blend. The result is a true reserve wine that represents less than 2 percent of our Cabernet Sauvignon production.

All Schlumberger wines are estate-grown. Seventy five percent of the vines are planted on very steep, terraced slopes, requiring horses be used for field work. The outstanding quality of the wines is due largely to Schlumberger's superior vineyards, but also because yields are deliberately kept low. With a base of red sandstone, the Kitterle's permeable soil also includes plenty of quartz mixed with sand and gravel. This combination results in extremely rich wines and a very low yield.

We stop the fermentation at about 7% residual sugar, and we clean the wine rapidly to retain as much freshness and fruitiness as possible. We leave a fair amount of carbon dioxide in the wine to create a lively feeling to the wine although it's not spritzy. The resulting wine is moderately sweet and refreshingly low in alcohol with flavors of pineapple and peach.

The wine is 100% stainless steel fermented with no malo-lactic fermentations. This technique has allowed us to capture the true aromas and flavors from each of these vineyard sites. The cool summer of 2010 allowed for extremely slow flavor development that resulted in aromas of Sun Crest peaches, Red Gravenstein apples, Fantasia nectarines and Muscat Canelli grapes. The flavors are quite similar, but with a refreshing blast of acidity that reminds you of tropical fruits.

"Kingston Family Cariblanco Sauvignon Blanc 2008",14.5,2008,19.49,"South America","Sauvignon Blanc","White Wines","While both 2008 and 2007 gave us low yields in the vineyard, the way those low yields played out in the wines is quite different. The 2007 had a steely intensity that the 2008 does not have. In its place is a somewhat more gentle quality, still with plenty of the citrusy/minerally/spicy quality that seems to be definitive of the vineyard but with a mouthfeel that is, well, softer. I think it will probably open up more quickly than the 2007 did. Like always, Cariblanco strikes me as having one foot in the new world, with its vibrant fruitiness, and one foot in the old world, with the minerally and waxy notes, somewhat reminiscent of Sancerre."

Rully is a delicious white Burgundy wine which resembles the whites from the Cote de Beaune: a luminous, golden green colour, a toasty, fruity nose, a refined, elegant body with floral and cinnamon notes. This exquisite wine, which goes so well with delicate fish and most shellfish, is also an excellent value."

"Joseph Drouhin St. Veran 2008",13,2008,16.99,"France - Other regions","Chardonnay","White Wines","At the southern end of Burgundy, just north of Beaujolais. The appellation Saint-Veran is actually larger than the territory of the commune. The actual village of Saint-Verand is spelled differently (note the final d). Established by decree in 1971, it is the latest appellation in the Maconnais region. The soil is Jurassic limestone, a continuation of the chalky strata found in the Cote d'Or, ideal for growing Chardonnay grapes. A wine that smiles and makes you smile! It is stylistically close to Pouilly-Fuisse, with its golden hue, its greenish reflection and its refreshing taste. The aromas are reminiscent of the ripe Chardonnay grape, with subtle notes of musk. A pleasant roundness coats the palate. The wines show great purity of taste and a pleasant floral style. The whites of Cote d'Or and Cote Chalonnaise are floral, with more texture.

"Dutton Goldfield Rued Vineyard Chardonnay 2011",13.5,2011,49.99,"California","Chardonnay","White Wines","As a winemaker, some wines you craft just perfectly suit your ow n tastes. The 2011 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay is definitely in this group; its combination of focus and opulence, plush fruit and steely minerality are exactly what we strive for in this bottling. The cold, damp 2011 season perfectly suited Dutton Ranch's attentive farming, and the character of the old, dry farmed Chard vines. Their sparse canopy, low yield and great health produced concentrated fruit in a year where many were less pleased. The wine shows the crystalline citrus fruit and freshness so quintessential to this neighborhood. In the nose, it leads with lemon curd,buttercream and a touch of tangerine fantas tic concentration and focus. The mouth is refreshing and luscious at the same time. Meyer lemon, a hint of toffee, and mandarin orange fill out the middle, while the creamy tropical overtones round out the edges.

Our Estate Chardonnay is a classic food wine - roasted cauliflower and cannellini bean salad, thyme-roasted chicken with buttermilk-mashed potatoes and a salad of baby greens, smoky ham and corn chowder. Salmon rillettes on buttered brioche would be a perfect hors d'oeuvre."
"Boutari Santorini 2012",13.5,2012,24.99,"Greece","Other White Blends","White Wines","Brilliant, pale yellow. Distinct aroma of citrus fruit. Full balance with flavors of fig and plum. Great balance with a long aromatic finish."
